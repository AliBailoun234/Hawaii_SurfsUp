### Overview of the project
	The overview of this project is to broadly analyze the temperature of select locations in Hawaii.
The project studies several locations, and within each locations there are several reference points in which data is obtained. 
The weather and statistics obtained in this project focus on the months of June and December only, as to study the hottest and coldest months (perhaps) of the year.

### Results
1. The weather stays relatively the same throughout the year, (more specifically between the months of June and December), where it ranges between 56 and 85.
2. There isn't much relative change in weather between the two months studied
3. There was more data obtained in the month of June over the years than in the month of December, which gives the month of June more accuracy and precision of its data.

### Summary
Similar weather data are present between both months of June and December, but more information perhaps is required to study the island of hawaii.
One additional query or statistic that could be obtained is perhaps rain and wind speed throughout the months studied.
Another additional query or statistic that could be studied is limiting the time to daytime only rather than studying the temperature across the whole day which includes day and night, the 24 hours.
